# Hearty-Delights-Website
Created a Fake restaurant, and established a website that will incorporate a multipage, and responsive webpage.
As promised, I want you to create a fictional restaurant.
This restaurant needs a web presence. I want you to pretend that you're a freelance web developer that is trying to get their first commission.
This assignment is similar to your in-class assignment from the other day, except now I am your client. I want to see two designs for my take out restaurant, and a fully-realized implementation of one of those designs. Naturally, I am a terrible client and don't know what sort of food I'll be serving (I haven't hired a chef yet), so I will leave it to you to come up with a theme for my restaurant. Feel free to peruse restaurant websites to get an idea of the sort of material that is presented.
At this point you know all of the HTML tags you need to put this together. Feel free to add as much CSS flair as you want.
General Requirements
Here is exactly what you need to deliver to me, the client. the following sections:
• Header
• Navigation
• Content area
• Footer
For each page, you will need at minimum
This website will comprise multiple pages. You will need, at minimum, three separate pages (i.e., don't make one of those gigantic single-page websites. There is a time and place for those and this is not it). Note that all pages should have a common theme!
For the header, you will need:
• A logo or picture
• A heading text with the name of the restaurant
• The phone number of the restaurant (123 456 7890)
For the navigation, you will need:
• Links to each of the webpages (home, menu, contact)
• Make each link part of a bulleted list that has no bullet (i.e., remove the bullets with CSS).
For the content areas, you will need: • Homepage

Part 1
1) Two different layout ideas. When designing a website for a customer, generally you'll need
more than one idea to present.
Deliverables:
• Two sample website designs that are different in style
o Each distinct area should be labeled with the type of content that will be eventually
in there
o Each file should be viewable without the need for special software (i.e., a PDF,
PNG, etc.)
For this, you should bring your initial concepts to class on Thursday to work on implementing. It will all be due as one big packet, so if you feel you need to clean it up later you can take extra time to make it pretty. We'll be grading this part on clarity of presentation, that you have all required sections clearly labeled, etc.
Part 2 – In Class
Select your favorite layout idea and work on implementing it. I will walk around and give feedback. For this, it will be helpful for you to create three pages and add a skeleton (blank regions with sample content). You can layout your sections with whichever HTML elements you see fit, give them borders, and add some content to ensure they are positioned correctly. Please take a screenshot of each page and paste it into your report.

Part 3 – Out of Class
Fill your pages with the required content! Check the General Requirements section to make sure you have everything you need! Please turn in the last page of this report, filled in. If you are working in teams, clearly indicate both of your names. Note that this has to be hosted on your Google Cloud instance. If you are working in teams, pick one person who will host the website.
